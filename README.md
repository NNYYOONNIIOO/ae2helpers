Small addon for AE2 for 1.21.1. Adds the option to auto-import pending crafts in the crafting terminal. Also adds a "Crafting Result Import Card" item.

Includes compatibility with applied flux and me soul card. Since they both add upgrade slots to the pattern provider, I decided to
go the non-invasive route and just add a separate slot to avoid needing mixins into those mods.
